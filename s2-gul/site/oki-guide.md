# SFV Guile
## Season 2 Okizeme Guide

Right up front: if you are the kind of person who cares about this sort
of thing, this site is built out of Markdown documents which are hosted on
Github [here](https://github.com/weirdtales/sfv). The whole thing is *very*
messy and constitutes my personal SFV note book.


## Introduction: okizeme, Guile, and SFV

From Guile's perspective, okizeme in SFV can be optional; Guile can knock-down,
boom or wait, and be sufficiently threatening.

When Guile does want to apply pressure more formally, a `hard read`
is required: either the opponent will `KDR` (quick-rise) or `KDBR`
(back-rise). The third option, `KD` (no rise), can be accounted for with
`frame kills`. This `hard read` constitutes a risk (cost) and the potential
for a reward.

Guile works well at particular ranges and his okizeme game should
take those ranges into consideration. Successful application of a block-string
replete with frame traps is wasted if the resulting neutral range is of poor
value. Always try to place your opponent where it is least comfortable for
them to be. **Any** hit during okizeme **must** be converted well - the cost
of the risk demands it.

This guide, such as it is, is broken down into sections - one for each
knock-down move. Within each section, the knock-down will be briefly discussed
and some optimal okizeme setups provided.  Pay attention to the on-block
and on-hit data as this will inform your actions after the okizeme is applied.

Videos for each knock-down, rise type, and intial pressure tool are provided
to illustrate potential follow-up ideas. Also included is a quick overview
of simple `3f` and `4f` frame trap options on block.

## Notation and Nomenclature

As with prior work, the notation I use is mostly of my own devising. It is
heavily influenced by SRK and is a combination of US and JP styles.

Buttons are referred to as *light*, *medium*, and *heavy* - the first letter
of which is used in the shorthand notation.

The type of button is noted as either *p* or *k* for *punch* or *kick*.

Directions are the first letter of *stand*, *jump*, *crouch*, *forward*,
*backward*, *up*, and *down*. Or some combination thereof.

*Hash* (#) denotes an inline comment.

The shorthand notation uses *periods* to separate attributes of a move and
*parens* to apply some kind of state if applicable:

`b.throw(air)  # back throw in the air`


### Okizeme specific notation

*Pipes* split strings into those executed for *KDR* or *KDBR* and those
executed for *KD* only:

`f.dash s.mp | c.mp c.mp s.mp  # left side of pipe for KDR`

*Parens* in strings that contain *numbers split by a forward slash* will
refer to the hit and block advantage for that string's ender:

`f.dash s.mp(7/3) | ...  # s.mp is at +7 on hit and +3 on block if opp. KDRs`

An *asterisk* before a move notation indicates the move can create a *Crush
Counter*:

`f.dash *b.hp(2/-1) | ...  # on CH, b.hp CCs`


## Sonic Boom

There's rarely a *need* for Guile to apply okizeme pressure with normals as
sonic boom is usually the best and safest option. Be aware that regular sonic
boom is active on `frame 10` and has a total frame count of `38f`. If you are
at greater advantage than `38f`, you cannot be punished for throwing a boom.

If you are between `+10f` and `+37f`, use your best judgement. Any lower than
`+10f` and you're gambling.

Where sonic boom is a usable okizeme option, I will make note of it along
with which *strength* is best.

## Flying Buster Drop
*back throw (air)*

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|2|2|51|

Note: use this throw for side-switch purposes.

There's nothing to work with here that is realistic. If you react to the *KD*
scenario, you have time to manually apply oki pressure with your weapon
of choice.


## Crouch HK

| Hit # | KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:-----:|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|1|3|8|52|
|2|21|26|70|

Note: 2nd hit creates an extra `18f` of advantage for Guile - this is the
same length as `f.dash`.

Scoring a knock-down with `c.hk` is not unusual and while the fastest
recovery option doesn't allow for meaty pressure, Guile still scores
counter-hits against 3f normals. As the *note* above indicates, landing the
knock-down off the second hit of crouch HK adds `18f` of extra advantage to
the equation. Simply dash forward to create a 1st hit situation.

There is one good reason to have strong `KD` options on call - *Crush Counter*
`c.hk`. This leads to a guaranteed setup - no small thing. I have included a
`KD` specific section after `KDR` and `KDBR`.

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>versus 4f characters</strong>
If range allows, `s.mk` covers both `KDR` and `KDBR` versus `4f` characters.
</p>


### KDR

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`c.mp`|3|5|1| |`2f` gap|
|`s.mp`|6|8|2| |`2f` gap|
|`s.lk`|4|6|2| | |

The advantage is very low at `+3f`, so no meaty and keep it simple.


#### crouch MP

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+1 on block</strong>
trap `3f` and `4f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`
</p>

While not nearly as strong as `s.mp`, `c.mp` cancels into `boom` and from
the right distance, Guile can link into `c.hk` for additional insult.

* `c.mp(3/1) | c.lk~c.lk s.mp(8/4)  # chained c.lk - not great`
* `c.mp(3/1) | c.mk *b.hp(4/1)`
* `c.mp(3/1) | s.lk f.hk(8/0)`

<p class="yt">

</p>


#### stand MP

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+2 on block</strong>
trap `3f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`<br/>
trap `4f` buttons with `6f` normals: `s.mp`, `c.mp`
</p>

This is always a strong option when close to your opponent. Being at `+2f`
works well for trapping with throws and Guile has good `4f` tick normals.

* `s.mp(6/2) | s.mk s.mp(8/4)`
* `s.mp(6/2) | c.mk *b.hp(3/0)`
* `s.mp(6/2) | c.lk f.hk(8/0)`

<p class="yt">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5GducWrVLI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>


#### stand LK

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+2 on block</strong>
trap `3f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`<br/>
trap `4f` buttons with `6f` normals: `s.mp`, `c.mp`
</p>

Technically safer than `s.mp` due to fewer total frames, `s.lk` makes
for a good tick option. The problem with a fast oki normal like this is that
branching for *KD* becomes more difficult.

* `s.lk(4/2) | b.hp s.mp(8/4)`
* `s.lk(4/2) | s.hp *b.hp(4/1)`
* `s.lk(4/2) | c.mp f.hk(8/0)`

<p class="yt">

### KDBR

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`s.mk`|5|7|1| | |
|`b.hp`|3|CC|0| | |

`+8f` is an annoying number of frames to meaty and be safe on block. These two
options are really the best of a bad bunch - `b.hp` is obviously a solid move.

Both `b.lk` and `f.mk` are serviceable at `-2f` on block.


#### stand MK

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+1 on block</strong>
trap `3f` and `4f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`
</p>

If facing a `4f` character, this is a fantastic option as it covers both
recovery types. Subtract `2f` from the numbers for `s.mk` below if the
opponent opts for `KDR` instead.

Versus a `3f` character, this option is useful on hit as it's at a deceptive
advantage, but damage conversion options may be limited.

* `s.mk(5/1) | s.mp s.mp(8/4)`
* `s.mk(5/1) | c.mp *b.hp(3/0)`
* `s.mk(5/1) | s.lp f.hk(6/-2)`

#### burn straight

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>0 on block</strong>
No traps.
</p>

There's never a bad time to stick one of these out, but be aware that you
are resetting the neutral by using this normal. As you are unlikely to see
a straight hit with this normal (CC or block are the most common outcomes),
prepare for block, be ready for CC.

* `b.hp(3/0) | s.lk s.mp(8/4)`
* `b.hp(3/0) | s.lp *b.hp(4/1)`

<p class="yt">

</p>


### KD

*1st hit c.hk CC*

As noted above, `KD` is guaranteed if the opponent is *Crush Countered*. Use
these setups to apply specific meaty pressure:

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`c.lp`|6|8|4|`f.dash f.mk`|`s.lk` is the same data|
|`s.mp`|7|9|3|`f,dash b.lk`| |
|`b.lk`|3|5|1|`b.lk s.lp`| |
|`b.hp`|4|CC|1|`b.lk s.lk`| |
|`f.hk`|7|9|-1|`f.dash f.dash`| |

## Dragon Suplex
*forward/neutral throw*

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|5|5|54|

Not much to work with, but with a couple of good `6f` normals, Guile can
apply pressure in the corner off this throw. Outside of the corner, look to
pressure with `s.hk`, `f.mk`, `f.hp`, and the like - manually.


### KDR and KDBR

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`s.lk`|6|8|4| |corner only |
|`c.mp`|3|5|1| |corner only |
|`b.hp`|2|CC|-1| |corner only, `2f` gap|


#### stand LK

<p class="trap-note">

trap `4f` buttons with `8f` normals: `s.hp`, `c.hp`, `b.hp`
</p>

Perfectly meaty so comes with excellent advantage, but no range to use it,
unfortunately. On CH, you can link to `c.hk` or `b.hp`.

* `s.lk(6/4) | s.hk s.mp(6/2)`
* `s.lk(6/4) | b.hp *b.hp(4/1)  # chef's special`
* `s.lk(6/4) | c.mk f.hk(7/-1)`

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+1 on block</strong>

</p>

The block advantage here is pretty poor, but as it's easily cancellable,
`c.mp` will usually find a seat at the table.

* `c.mp(3/1) | c.hp c.mp(4/2)`
* `c.mp(3/1) | f.dash f.hk(7/-1)`

This goes active on the opponents 3rd wake-up frame, so really you're looking
for a *Crush Counter* with this option.

* `b.hp(2/-1) | f.dash s.mp(7/3)`
* `b.hp(2/-1) | s.lk *b.hp(4/1)  # house speciality`

## Judo Throw
*back throw*

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|14|14|63|

Unless you're throwing into the corner, there aren't too many options due
to the spacing. You can manually time a `c.mp` for good wake-up pressure.

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>Shenanigans</strong>
After a successful `b.throw`, Guile can walk forward slightly and then throw
again. The timing is tight, but manageable although it may not work on some
characters (small hurtboxes when crouching, for example).
</p>


### KDR and KDBR

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`s.hk`|3|5|-2| | |
|`f.hk`|6|8|-2| |`1f` gap|


#### stand HK

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>-2 on block</strong>
No traps.
</p>

At `+3f` on regular hit, there's no natural combo off this, but as a
counter-hit, Guile can link into any of his `4f` normals and cancel that
into a `boom` or `fk`.

Committing to a `4f` normal on non-counter-hit or block is safe and can lead
to good baiting scenarios.

Against `4f` characters, you can follow a blocked `s.hk` with a `6f` medium
(`s.mp` or `c.mp`) - this allows for manual counter-hit confirmation if they
try and take a turn with a light button.

* `s.hk(3/-2) | c.mk s.mp(7/3)`
* `s.hk(3/-2) | c.mp *b.hp(4/1)`
* `s.hk(3/-2) | s.lp f.hk(7/-1)`

#### reverse spin kick

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>-2 on block</strong>
No traps.
</p>

This normal **is not meaty** and connects on the `2nd` wake-up frame (`1f`
gap), but provides much improved frame advantage on hit over `s.hk`.

This option should be the default choice in this situation (`b.throw`,
KDR/KDBR).

* `f.hk(6/-2) | c.mp s.mp(8/4)`
* `f.hk(6/-2) | f.dash *b.hp(4/1)`
* `f.hk(6/-2) | s.lp f.hk(6/-2)`

## Reverse Back Knuckle
*V Reversal*

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|18|23|77|

There's nothing here to work with due to the range. Just wait or flick out
a boom. If you want to manually stick something into the mixer, `f.hk` and
`s.hk` only require brief delays against `KDR`.


## Flash Kick

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|24|29|83|

After `fk` knock-down, Guile can only apply pressure with a `boom` or `f.dash`
followed by a normal. Depending on the opponent, `boom` may leave Guile open
to punishment (i.e., Nash's Critical Art on wake-up). In order to apply
pressure with a normal, the Guile player must know if the `fk` connected on
the first active frame or not - this is the subtlety of the `fk`.

The following setups are built on a first-active-frame knock-down scenario. If
Guile AAs or hits from range, additional advantage is conferred and can
destabilize his okizeme.


### KDR

| Option | On hit | On counter-hit | On block | Frame kill | Notes |
|-------:|:------:|:--------------:|:--------:|:----------:|:------|
|`c.mp`|4|6|2|`f.dash`| |
|`s.mp`|7|9|3|`f.dash`| |
|`b.hp`|2|CC|-1|`f.dash`|`1f` gap|


#### crouch MP

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+2 on block</strong>
trap `3f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`<br/>
trap `4f` buttons with `6f` normals: `s.mp`, `c.mp`
</p>

There's no good reason to use `c.mp` over `s.mp` as range is not a
consideration in this situation.

* `f.dash c.mp(4/2) | df.hk s.mp(8/4)`
* `f.dash c.mp(4/2) | f.hk *b.hp(4/1)`
* `f.dash c.mp(4/2) | s.hp f.hk(8/0)`

#### stand MP

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+3 on block</strong>
trap `3f` buttons with `6f` normals: `s.mp`, `c.mp`<br/>
trap `4f` buttons with `6f` or `7f` normals: `s.mp`, `c.mp`, `s.mk`, `c.mk`, `c.hk`
</p>

Still a solid go-to and at `+3f` on block, very good for trapping. On hit,
can be linked to `6f` and `7f` normals. Given `6f` normals CH `3f` responses
on block, the safest and most reliable option after `f.dash s.mp` is `c.mp`.

*Note: the following setups are the same as the ones used for `c.mp`, but
provide 1 less frame of advantage versus `KD`*

* `f.dash s.mp(7/3) | df.hk s.mp(7/3)`
* `f.dash s.mp(7/3) | f.hk *b.hp(3/0)`
* `f.dash s.mp(7/3) | s.hp f.hk(7/-1)`

|`c.hp`|6|8|0|`f.dash`|whiffs on crouching|
|`f.hp`|6|CC|1|`f.dash`|whiffs on crouching|

No options versus `KDBR` offer good advantage on block and both `c.hp` and
`f.hp` whiff if the opponent is crouching. In non-cornered situations,
`hp.boom` will often catch the opponent meaty on `KDBR` so may be a
consideration.


#### bazooka knee

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>+1 on block</strong>
trap `3f` and `4f` buttons with `4f` normals: `s.lp`, `s.lk`, `c.lp`, `c.lk`
</p>

For this recovery type, `bazooka knee` is probably the best option. If a little
more range is desirable after the pressure is applied (in the case of block,
for example), `rolling sobat` leaves Guile in a slightly better position.

* `f.dash b.lk(3/1) | b.hp s.mp(8/4)`
* `f.dash b.lk(3/1) | b.lk *b.hp(4/1)`
* `f.dash b.lk(3/1) | c.mp f.hk(8/0)`

#### rolling sobat

<p class="trap-note">
<strong>-1 on block</strong>
No traps.
</p>

Like `bazooka knee`, `rolling sobat` offers little in terms of reward on hit,
but can leave Guile at a good range to threaten follow-up responses.

*As `f.mk` is a `29f` move and `b.lk` is a `28f` move, the setups for `b.lk`
work interchangeably - Guile loses `1f` of advantage in exchange*

* `f.dash f.mk(3/-1) | f.mk s.mp(8/4)`
* `f.dash f.mk(3/-1) | b.lk *b.hp(3/0)`

As noted, this normal whiffs against crouching opponents and even when
perfectly meaty (last frame), it only offers `0f` on block.

|:---:|:----:|:--:|

With the same knock-down advantage as `fk` `KDBR`, `flying mare` okizeme is
easy to set up, but comes with limited on-block advantage. Just remember
that any setup you like for `fk` `KDBR` will work in this situation.

The range at which Guile is left is sufficiently close that killing frames
with a movement normal is not necessarily required - this can lead to esoteric,
but strong options for okizeme pressure.

## Burn Straight (CC)
*back HP*

Successful okizeme after `b.hp`(cc) relies on knowledge of the advantage
that the `b.hp` connected with. Refer to the notes column for hints.

Like `swing-out`, `b.hp`(cc) can be followed up with a `boom` for safe
pressure.

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>`sonic boom`</strong>
Light boom is the ticket here. Heavy boom will catch `KDBR` meaty. `KD`
will always result in a miss for the boom, but you're at sufficient frame
advantage to dash in and still make a play for some action.

### KD - post sonic boom

If the opponent opts for `KD` after Guile fires off a `sonic boom`, the
following strings will provide good wake-up pressure.

* `boom f.dash s.hk s.mp(8/4)`
* `boom b.lk c.mk *b.hp(3/0)`
* `boom f.dash s.mk f.hk(8/0)`

## Guile High Kick
*down-forward HK*

A rare option is running okizeme off `df.hk`, but there may be valid
considerations for it. Much like a reset, but with an arguably inferior
convertion rate, successful okizeme can yield very high damage. Also,
choosing to run a wake-up game off this normal will be unexpected and the
savvy opponent will likely test your unusual choice.

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>`sonic boom`</strong>
Light boom should be okay for `KDR`, but it can miss if Guile is too close
to the opponent.
Medium is a good choice for `KDBR`.

## EX Sonic Boom / Sonic Tempest

Achieving stability with `ex.boom` is somewhat finicky due to the change
in advantage at range: when executed point-blank, advantage could be up to
`5 frames` lower than at range.

The first okizeme section below will deal with stable `ex.boom` pressure -
that is, close-range `ex.boom`. The latter will be at the *standard* range -
that is, the range at which the following *combo* executes the `ex.boom` at:

* `j.hp s.hp c.mp xx ex.boom`

Considering okizeme for `sonic tempest` is not on my todo list.

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>shenanigans</strong>
When executed from close-range, the `ex.boom` knock-down can be `reset`
by using `b.lk`.
</p>

<p class="shen-note">
<strong>`sonic boom`</strong>
Delay slightly and use light boom for both recoveries. A heavy boom can meaty
`KDBR` if timed well.

### Close Range EX Boom

| KDR | KDBR | KD |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|
|48|53|107|

At close-range, `ex.boom` offers a sequence which covers both `KDR` and
`KDBR` versus `4f` characters.
