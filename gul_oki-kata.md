# Okizeme Kata

In Japanese martial arts, patterns are referred to as Kata (lit. form). I have
devised some okizeme kata which will allow study and execution practice. The
goal of mastering these kata is to ensure that your muscle memory can execute
frame-perfect okizeme on demand. This should free your mind to focus on more
important things.

## Settings
Enter training mode and set the dummy up as follows:

* **State** Stand
* **Guard** After First Attack
* **Recovery** Normal Recovery (or Back Recovery as appropriate)
* **Counter** Normal
* **Stun** No Stun

Record a 3 frame normal and use this as the wake-up action.

Consider also setting all gauges to infinite.
