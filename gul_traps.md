# Guile Traps
## Introduction
Traps, or more formally, frame traps, are the means by which a player
intentionally inserts small gaps into possible block-strings such that if the
opponent presses a button, a counter-hit will occur allowing the attacker to
convert into a specialized combo.

The first understanding a player must have in order to apply safe
(unpunishable) traps is what retaliation options the opponent has. There are 3
possible options a player has when blocking:

* continue blocking
* look to punish combo drops or gaps with a normal, throw, special, or CA
* jump

Effective traps should exploit the second listed option thus knowing how fast
your opponents responses are is key. This data will change once meter is on the
table.

Characters in SFV are divided into two groups with respect to the speed of
their fastest normal: 3 frame and 4 frame. Consult the following:

### Nomenclature
* **block-stun** the state of a character during block
* **response** an active counter or retaliation from an opponent leaving block-stun
* **trap** frame trap; intentional response window during block-string
* **window** the gap in a frame trap; the width of a window is measure in frames
* **clean trap** a trap for which the starter is blocked on its first active frame
* **meaty trap** a trap for which the starter is blocked after its first active frame
