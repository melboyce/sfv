# SWEEP PUSH-OUT STRINGS
The following strings allow testing of c.hk, max distance punish options. They
are "on block" and should connect at the maximum possible range for the
characters c.hk. Each string starts from point-blank range.


## Disclaimer
Although I've tested as thoroughly as I can, this is not scientific - just
futzing around with moves until I reckon it's about right. Them's the breaks.
Accept that you may be a few pixels closer than max range.


## Method of Discovery
Opponent set to "all guard", placed in left corner. At the end of the string,
c.hk should be blocked, but the slightest backward movement should cause the
c.hk to whiff. Also tested mid-screen.


## Method of Execution
You should be good to execute the strings with a small delay between each part
(unless it's a dash) to ensure stability and with, where applicable, a neutral
stick. Be sure to check you've got it down before practicing a punish.
