# Guile c.hk punish table
This is a list of all punishes which will work against a max range blocked
c.hk. Use your judgement for better options based on range, but this serves as
a list of defaults - they will work at any range.

## Assumptions
* meaty c.hk may be unpunishable
* CA probably works vs. all characters as a punish
* ex.fk will be listed as "works" only if 2 hits will connect
* boom may refer to any version (button) - h.boom to be sure
* a question mark (?) indicates a punish is untested
* bazooka knee and sobat are listed as b.lk and f.mk respectively
