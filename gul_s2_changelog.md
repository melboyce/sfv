# Guile - Season 2 Changelog

This information is taken from Circa_LPNs analysis which was submitted
to pvplive.net. As this is `humint`, expect inaccuracy.


## Changes
* V-Trigger bar changed from 3 to 2
* `c.mp` push-back increased
* `s.hp` no longer creates Crush Counter state
* `c.hp` creates Crush Counter state


## Notes

### Boom Loops
With more push-back on `c.mp`, existing corner boom loop setups will no
longer work.  Time to practice looping with `s.lk~s.mk c.lp` loops instead
(pretty sure this works).

### Crush Counter Changes
`c.hp` is a tool that can be set up to apply great okizeme - assuming the
frame data doesn't change, it can be made safe, so learn the setups.
